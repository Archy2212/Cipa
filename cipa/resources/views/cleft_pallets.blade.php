<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
            <p >A cleft is a split or gap in a structure.  A split upper lip is called a Cleft Lip, while the term Cleft Palate is used when the gap involves the roof of the mouth.  The deformity has variable degree of severity.  In its mildest form, there is only a slight notching of the upper lip.  The most severe form involves a cleft of the lip, the palate as well as the intervening alveolus (the bony ridge from which the teeth erupt).  This is known as a Complete Cleft Lip and Palate.  The deformity may affect only one side (a Unilateral Cleft), or both sides may be involved (a Bilateral Cleft).</p>

            <p>
            Whatever the deformity, surgical procedures are available to repair the gap.  This must be undertaken by a trained Plastic Surgeon.  He will work closely with an Orthodontist (Specialist Dentist) and speech language pathologist.  If your child has only a Cleft Lip, one operation will suffice to correct it.  He or she will look and speak normally and the scar will scarcely be visible in later years.  Similarly when only cleft palate is present, single operation will suffice to close the defect in the roof of the mouth.
               </p>

            <p>If your child has Cleft Lip and Palate, two operations will be needed during infancy before the gap is completely closed.  You must expect that with more severe deformity, your child may speak differently from normal children and will therefore require speech therapy.  In addition, regular visits to the Orthodontist will be necessary.</p>

            <button class="accordion" style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"><span><span><b>How often does it occur?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
            <p >In India, approximately 1 in every 700 babies is born with a Cleft deformity.  This means that there are more than 20 lac patients of clefts in our country, which are being managed by around 2000 cleft surgeons. Every year 30,000 to 35,000 children with cleft lip or cleft palate or cleft lip and palate are added to our Indian society.</p>

            <p>
            Cleft lip occurs more often in boys and cleft palate is encountered more often in girls. This speaks of the magnitude of problem existing in our country.

       <button class="accordion" style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"><span><span><b>What causes a cleft lip and cleft palate?  “Is it my fault?”</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
      
      
            <p>In fact we do not know the answer to this question fully. During early pregnancy, the different parts of the head and face first develop separately and later fuse with each other.  Defective fusion of these parts can result in a cleft deformity.  The exact cause of clefts is not clear, but we know that both genetic and environmental factors play their roles.  Some situations that could result in a cleft deformity are: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>1. A woman who has had rubella infection (German Measles) during early pregnancy.</li>
            <li>2. The use of certain drugs by a woman during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>3. Chromosomal disorders such as Mongolism (Down’s Syndrome)</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>In most cases, there is no identifiable cause i.e. the occurrence of the deformity is sporadic.  Therefore, in the vast majority of cases, the birth of a baby with a cleft deformity is no one’s fault.<b>  It is not due to something you did. So you should not have any feeling of guilt.</b></p>
            <p>Cleft lip and cleft palate may be more likely to occur in pregnant women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol and take certain medications. The main environmental factors which have been reported as possibly increasing the risk of orofacial clefts are tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, solvents and agricultural chemicals. Certain types of anti-epileptic drugs have also been reported to increase the risk. </p>
            <p>Many people believe that cutting a vegetable or holding sharp objects during pregnancy, watching solar eclipse, evil act, karma, incarnation, witchcraft, God’s punishment, eating rabbit meat, adultery by mother, Djinn (evil spirits), black magic or walking outdoor on Amavasya may cause cleft in the new born. On the other hand many community consider it as God’s gift. However, these are only beliefs and there is no scientific basis to any one of them. Scientifically we consider these causes as only myth. Hence please do not them seriously. </p>
            <p></div>


     <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> <span><span><b>Will my next baby have a cleft?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>It is unlikely.  There is dependable evidence of its occurrence in family. The risk of occurrence of cleft lip and palate is more in families where already the parents or grand parents or other siblings have cleft. So if there is history of cleft in two or more family members, the chances of cleft in next child is high. </p>

            <p>Depending on the situation, the following probabilities have been worked out:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. IF BOTH PARENTS ARE NORMAL AND 1 CHILD HAS A CLEFT; the chance of the second child having a cleft is 1 in 20.</li>
<li>2. IF BOTH PARENTS ARE NORMAL AND BOTH 1ST AND 2ND CHILDREN HAVE CLEFTS, The chance of the next child having a cleft is 1 in 4.</li>
<li>3. IF 1 PARENT HAS A CLEFT, The chance of the first child having a cleft is 1 in 20.</li>
<li>IF 1 PARENT HAS A CLEFT AND 1 CHILD HAS A CLEFT, The chance of the next child having a cleft is 1 in 4.</li>
<li>4. IF BOTH THE PARENTS HAVE CLEFTS, The chance of the first child having a cleft is 1 in 4.</li></ul><p>If you have any doubts, your Surgeon will refer you to the Geneticist who will provide you with genetic counselling.</p><br>

 <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> <span><span><b>How Are Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate Diagnosed?</b></span></span></span></button>
<div class="panel"  style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Now the orofacial clefts are quite commonly diagnosed during pregnancy, usually by a routine ultrasound. New 3D ultrasounds give very clear picture of the baby’s face and one can see the cleft lip in 18 week baby in uterus. In routine, orofacial clefts are diagnosed after the baby is born. However, sometimes minor clefts (e.g., submucous cleft palate and bifid uvula) might not be diagnosed until later in life.</p>

<p>If the clefting has not been detected in an ultrasound prior to the baby's birth, a physical examination of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms the presence of cleft lip or cleft palate after a child's birth. Sometimes diagnostic testing may be conducted to determine or rule out the presence of other abnormalities.</p>

       <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;">  <span><span><b>What Problems Are Associated With Cleft Lip and/or Palate?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
           <p>There are few problems associated with cleft lip and palate. There are some related to cleft lip and some special problems are associated with cleft palate.</p>

<p>The problems with cleft lip are mainly cosmetic problem. It does not look good in centre of the face and attracts public attention. But there is not much functional problem with cleft lip. The teeth may be deformed in the region of the cleft lip but all other functions remain normal.</p>

<p>Cleft palate is more notorious and cause large number of functional problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    1.  Feeding problem
  </li>
  <li>
    2.  Nutritional deficiency because of difficulty in feeding
  </li>
  <li>
    3.  General growth may be affected because of deficient nutrition.
  </li>
  <li>
    4.  Child swallows more air and so causes vomiting after feeding.
  </li>
  <li>
    5.  Speech may be abnormal
  </li>
  <li>
    6.  Teeth may be deformed
  </li>
  <li>
    7.  Midface (Maxilla) may not develop adequately causing depressed central face.
  </li>
  <li>
    8.  Middle ear infection and discharging ear
  </li>
  <li>
    9.  Hearing may be affected
  </li>
  <li>
    10. Recurrent respiratory infection may occur.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the important problems are given in detail in following questions.</p></div>

<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
     
   
            <p>Babies with clefts have trouble with feeding because the normal anatomy of the oral cavity is disrupted. Normally, a baby pulls the nipple into the mouth and makes a seal with the lips around the nipple. When a baby sucks and swallows, their palate rises up and closes off the mouth from the nose. This creates suction so that the breast or bottle nipple is held in the mouth and the milk is drawn out. When a cleft lip is present, it may be difficult for the baby to make a good seal around the nipple. When a cleft palate is present, the mouth cannot be closed off from the nose and little or no suction can be created.</p>

<p>Your baby may suck more slowly and feeding time may be longer.  Do not be alarmed if some of the feeds flow out through the nose, causing spluttering or coughing.  This is due to the cleft in the palate.  You must be gentle and patient.  Do not rush a feed or choking may result.  Prolonged feeding may exhaust your child, so use smaller feeds but at more frequent intervals.</p> </div>

   <span><span><b>How should I feed my baby?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p><b>Cleft lip:</b> For breastfeeding babies, the soft breast tissue often will fill the opening in the lip and/or gum line well, sealing off the mouth and allowing the baby to create adequate suction. Sometimes it is helpful for the mother to hold a finger across the cleft during feeding. Swallowing noises and a bowel movement after feeding are signs that breast-feeding is going well. If the baby is "noisy" with feeding, making clicking or kissing noises, suction may not be adequate.</p><p>
          Mothers who choose to bottle-feed their babies with cleft lip should try using nipples with a wider base, or their infants may need special bottles or nipples. When starting a feeding, hold the baby in a slightly upright position. Touch the baby's lower lip with the nipple. When the baby latches on, direct the nipple slightly downwards. Try to keep the nipple in the center of the baby's mouth. Do not let it slip up into the cleft.
          </p>

<p><b>Cleft Palate-</b> with or without Cleft Lip:  Babies with cleft palate usually need special bottles and techniques to feed adequately. It's rarely possible to breastfeed or use a regular bottle because the baby's nose and mouth are not separated and they cannot create suction to get the milk out of the breast or bottle. A baby who is put to the breast may look like they are sucking well, but they are using up energy and getting little or no milk. We encourage mothers who planned to breastfeed to express their milk and feed it to their infants using a special bottle or spoon. While breast milk is considered the most ideal food for all babies, there are added benefits for babies with cleft palate, such as a lower incidence of middle ear infection. </p>

<p>In India, we recommend spoon-feeding rather than bottle-feeding before the cleft is repaired. In some parts of the country, a cup with long nozzle known as “Paaladai” is used effectively. A baby who is not used to spoon-feeding may refuse such feeds during the postoperative period.  This may irritate the baby and cause excessive crying. Feeding can be done using a simple cup and spoon, paaladai, a feeding cup or a milk bottle with a spoon attachment.  Hold your baby lying well back in your arms and gently tip the milk from the spoon to the back of the tongue.  Spoon-feeding is slower but should be used at least until the Cleft Lip or Palate has been repaired.  Our nurses will teach you how to feed your baby correctly.</p>

   <span><span><b>Bottles?</b></span></span></button>
<div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>There are three types of bottles that we recommend for feeding babies with clefts - the Mead-Johnson Cleft Palate Nurser, the Haberman Feeder and the Pigeon Nipple:</p>
<p><img src="images/bottles.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>All of these bottles and nipples can be hand washed in hot soapy water, rinsed and allowed to thoroughly air dry. Do not boil the bottles or parts, wash them in the dishwasher or put them in a microwave. They may soften and start to leak.</p> </div>

      <span><span><b>How to Express Breast Milk?</b></span></span></button>
   <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Mothers who choose to express breast milk (using a pump or the hand to get milk out of the breast) for their babies should get a hospital-grade electric breast pump with a double pumping system. Birth hospitals have pumps for mothers to use in the hospital and can assist families with obtaining pumps for home use. Breast pumps can be rented or purchased. Mothers should pump at least eight times in 24 hours at first, including at least once during the night. After several weeks of this intensive pumping, most mothers can provide enough milk for their babies by pumping about six times a day.</p>    </div>
     
     <button class="accordion"  style=" color: #575652; font-size: 17px;"> 
      <span><span><b>How Much and how often the baby should feed?</b></span></span></button>
   <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Newborn babies begin taking small amounts, one ounce or less, of milk often, and gradually increase the amount they are able to drink. By 2 weeks of age, a baby needs to drink at least two to two and a half ounces of milk per pound of weight each day. No feeding session should take longer than 30 minutes. If it takes longer, the infant is working too hard and burning calories needed for growth. The measure of success of any feeding plan is adequate weight gain. During the first month of life, a baby will feed eight to twelve times per day, or every two to three hours. A baby this young usually feeds at least twice during the night. At 2 to 4 months old, a baby will feed six to eight times per day, or every three to four hours. </p>
<p>Weight gain: A baby usually loses weight the first week of life. Most times, the loss is 5 to10 % of body weight. This weight is regained with a baby returning to birth weight by 2 weeks old. The amount of weight gain expected for a baby is about five to seven ounces per week. At 4 to 6 months old, the rate of weight gain slows to about three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half ounces per week. Sometimes infants with cleft lip and palate will have difficulties taking enough breast milk or formula to grow. To help these babies grow, formula powder can be added to breast milk or regular formula for added calories, protein and vitamins. This should only be done under the supervision of the medical team and only with an approved recipe.</p></div>

      <span><span><b>What About Starting Solid Foods?</b></span></span></button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color:#d6d5d5; color: black;">
            <p>Babies with clefts can start solid foods at the same age as other babies, usually between 4 and 6 months of age. Experiment to find the right consistency for solids. It needs to be just right so that the baby can eat without the food coming through the nose. Again, this isn't harmful to the child and sneezing will usually clear the food out of the nose. Most babies learn quickly to get the food down their throats rather than out their noses.</p>
